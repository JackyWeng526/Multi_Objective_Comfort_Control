# Multi_Objective_Comfort_Control
This project aims to utilize a lightweight Comfort Control Module for energy and thermal comfort improvment in a car sales center in Taiwan.

According to the previous repositories, we have constructed a general AI model and workflow for fast convergence of data processing, training and predicting.

Here will display part of the datasets and outcomes of this field.

## Field Introduction & Datasets
Due to the privacy, we can only show the first floor plane of the car sales center.

And only one of the VRV datasets (about 2 months) can be shared in this repository.
